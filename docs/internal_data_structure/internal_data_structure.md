## Project

Basic resource to organize general user access for all collections registered in the project.
A project also acts as an umbrella container for one or multiple collections and has to be available before collection creation is possible.

## Collection

Basic resource to organize stored data i.e. Objects.
Collections can be described with more detailed metadata by registering one or multiple Object/s marked as _"specification"_ of the Collection.

Collections can also be versioned on-demand with a version number following semantic versioning principles.
On creation of a collection version the collection a shallow cloned and immutable copy of the collection is created.
The version number is defined manually by the user who pinpoints the Collection.

## Object

Resource which fundamentally stores the data in the backend storage system.
An Object can only be owned by one collection at a time but references can be created for multiple collections.
Depending on the context an Object can represent data or metadata.
Additionally, an Object has revisions

### State system

Objects in the storage have states.
These are used to indicate the status of an Object during its lifecycle.

* **INITIALIZING:** After Object creation/initialization but before Object finishing.
* **AVAILABLE:** After Object finishing if everything succeeded.
* **UNAVAILABLE:** E.g. while an Object is being updated or generally in the staging area.
* **ERROR:** If something went wrong e.g. data proxy endpoints are down.
* **TRASH:** Object was deleted and waits to be removed by the garbage collector.
* **DELETED:** Object was removed by the garbage collector but is still referenced by another Object.

## Label/Hook [optional]

Simple resource which represents a key-value pair which is directly associated with a Collection, Object or ObjectGroup.

<dl>
  <dt>Labels</dt>
  <dd>Used to describe short properties of the resource with which it is associated.</dd>

  <dt>Hooks</dt>
  <dd>Used to reference (external) services which automatically process/validate/... the data upon registration.</dd>
</dl>

## ObjectGroup [optional]

ObjectGroups are a secondary resource to organize Objects inside Collections.
